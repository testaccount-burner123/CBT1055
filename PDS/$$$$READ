Editor's note:  (April 2024)

The main code modules in this package were extensively modified by
Joe Reichman.  In the early 1990's when (the late) Mitchell Marx wrote
the original code, 64-bit registers were not available, and the code
as it originally was, did not hunt down the registers in the true
abending program, when that program was different from the program
which was ostensibly running.  Many times when you get an abend, the
symptom dump says that the moduie is unknown.  Joe's new code now
traces this down, in most cases, and discovers where the true abend
really took place.  This new information is both helpful and
eye-opening.

ALL REFERENCES FOR SUPPORT BY MITCHELL MARX, PENELOPE DAVIS, AND
MD-PALADIN ARE (UNFORTUNATELY) NOW OBSOLETE.  FOR SUPPORT, KINDLY
EMAIL JOE REICHMAN.
